<b>Proptech - the application of technology to real-estate markets.</b><br>
For this challenge, I've developed a Jupyter notebook that presents a comprehensive analysis of the San Francisco housing rental market, using the data provided. To showcase my skill-set in data visualization, I've incorporated interactive visuals and geospatial analysis, which enhance the presentation and interpretation of the data. Ultimately, my aim is to identify profitable investment opportunities within the San Francisco real estate market.
