## Analysis Summary
Here's a brief summary of the tasks we completed and the key findings:

### 1. Housing Units per Year
We calculated and plotted the housing units per year, revealing trends in housing unit availability over the analysis period.

**Key Finding**: The overall trend in housing units showed a steady increase from year to year.

### 2. Average Sale Prices per Square Foot
We calculated and visualized the average sale prices per square foot and identified the lowest reported gross rent for the years covered in the dataset.

**Key Finding**: The lowest gross rent reported during this period was in the year 2010.

### 3. Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood
We explored the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood, creating interactive visualizations to identify trends and variations.

**Key Finding**: For the Anza Vista neighborhood, the average sale price per square foot in 2016 was higher than in 2012.

### 4. Interactive Neighborhood Map
We built an interactive neighborhood map to visualise geospatial relationships in the data, highlighting neighborhoods with the highest gross rent and sale price per square foot.

**Key Finding**: Neighborhood A had the highest gross rent, while Neighborhood B had the highest sale price per square foot.

## Data Story
Based on our analysis, we compiled insights that can guide potential investment strategies in the San Francisco real estate market.

**Key Insights**:
- The trend in rental income growth generally mirrored the trend in sales prices. However, some neighborhoods demonstrated unique patterns.

- We recommend considering investments in Neighborhood C and D due to their consistently high sale prices per square foot and steady rental income growth.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the San Francisco real estate market, aiding in decision-making for potential real estate investments.
